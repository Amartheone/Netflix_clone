Here's a custom **README.md** file for your Netflix clone project, tailored to your provided code, images, and project requirements:

# Netflix Clone

A visually accurate static clone of Netflix’s landing page, built using **HTML** and **CSS** only.

This project is a front-end demonstration that replicates the look and feel of Netflix’s home experience, including responsive design, feature sections, FAQ, and a familiar navigation layout.

## Features

- **Pure HTML & CSS:** No JavaScript, no frameworks.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Netflix-style Layout:** Navigation bar, hero section, feature rows, and FAQ.
- **Reusable Components:** Buttons, inputs, and FAQ items built for modularity.
- **Visual Assets:** Uses Netflix-inspired banners, background images, and icons for an authentic look.
- **Accessible and Semantically Structured HTML.**

- **Not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, Netflix, Inc.**
